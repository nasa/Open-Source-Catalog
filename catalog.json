It includes algorithms for state estimation and prediction, including uncertainty propagation. The algorithms take as inputs component models developed in Matlab, and perform estimation and prediction functions. The library allows the rapid development of prognostics solutions for given models of components and systems. Different algorithms can be easily swapped to do comparative studies and evaluations of different algorithms to select the best for the application at hand.",

		"Description": "This code was created to support the Distributed Engine Control task as part of the Fixed Wing Aeronautics project. The purpose of this research was to enable multiple microcontrollers to speak with eacho ther per the protocol specified in the preliminary release of EADIN BUS. EADIN BUS is a candidate for distributed control systems on aircraft engines. The primary use of this code was to assist in the modeling of small local networks which contain 16 or fewer nodes. This communication protocol differs from typical internet protocols by using a master node which distributes information between nodes through a call and response system. The RS-485 network is simplex and thus does not allow multiple nodes to talk at the same time. No time synchronization between  nodes is required for this network. These factors enable the master to request information from sensors and command actuators, one at a time. In the current implementation, no information is passed from individual nodes without first going through the master node. While other communication protocols do exist like ModbusMaster and simple-modbus, the speed of these communication protocols on the RS-485 network was not sufficient for our needs which required message send to reply receipt times of 1 millisecond. Additionally, the other protocols did not implement the same message system as specified by the preliminary documents regarding the EADIN protocol.",

Over the past 50 years, NASA has collected a vast amount of data that has helped us better understand Earth, other planets in our solar system, and the depths of space. Almost all of of this data is now in the public domain petabytes upon petabytes waiting for you to explore. Although the Agency offers petabytes of publicly available data to the world from a variety of missions, only a small portion is accessible through API interfaces. NASA sees huge promise in web APIs, as they can enhance our ability to deliver data to both established and new audiences. The Digital Strategy mandate directed NASA to use web APIs to make available high-value data and content for at least two existing major customer-facing systems.",

The only required inputs are the surface crack dimensions (2c and a), plate cross-section dimensions (W and B), and linear plus power law material properties of elastic modulus, yield strength, and strain hardening coefficient. With the geometry and material parameters entered, TASC interpolates to the appropriate J(Φ) vs. crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and far-field tension stress, σ, vs. CMOD solution, providing the full solution as CMOD ranges from zero out to the CMOD limit of the solution space for the given input parameters. TASC was developed by the Material and Processes Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.",

Synchronization mechanisms allow configuration files to be kept consistent between systems as well as allowing commands to be executed across all servers of a particular type. Archival mechanisms provide automatic version control of configuration files to aid in recovery in case of errant configuration. Validation mechanisms allow configuration files to be automatically checked for correctness before they are installed on all peer servers.",

Multi-threading is used to ensure that nodes are kept as busy as possible. Double buffering allows individual operations within a single task to be overlapped using asynchronous I/O. Multi-node cooperation allows different nodes to take part in the same task. Split file processing allows multiple threads to operate concurrently on the same file. Finally, additional optimizations such as buffer management help eliminate other bottlenecks that can reduce performance. Mutil currently includes drop-in replacements for cp and md5sum from GNU coreutils, which have achieved 10/30x rates on one/many nodes.",

Mesh adheres to fundamental security principles and was designed to be compatible with strong security mechanisms including two-factor authentication, SSH bastions, and restrictive firewalls. Mesh uses a remote command model, which is based on stock SSH clients and the syntax and commands already understood by users, thus requires no additional software or knowledge to utilize effectively. Several existing services have been integrated with Mesh to provide resource discovery and query, high performance file transfer, and job management.",

		"Description": "The Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) program was established in 2001 to coordinate ground and flight data systems development and services at GSFC with the ultimate goal to efficiently support current and future GSFC mission services. The GMSEC architecture is a ground systems architecture that spans the full mission lifecycle from development through operations. The architecture provides a secure, scalable and extensible communications and data system that supports all aspects of a mission from onboard processing through the Mission Operations Center (MOC) to public access on the Internet. The architecture includes an Application Programming Interface (API) and message bus to provide a publish and subscribe communication mechanism. The GMSEC architecture and source code are based on an enterprise architecture approach with a message-oriented cross-platform enterprise middleware (information software bus).",

		"Description": "You might have noticed that we were a bit vague about what JPF actually is. It started as a software model checker, but nowadays there are various different execution modes and extensions, hence we have to explain what JPF does without getting lost in details of its application. What all JPF modes, which are runtime configured and not hardwired, have in common is that they are used to verify Java programs, to: find and explain defects, collect \"deep\" runtime information like coverage metrics, deduce interesting test vectors and create corresponding test drivers and many more... Although classic SW model checking is only one of these applications, it is still what JPF is mostly associated with. People often confuse this with testing, and indeed JPFs notion of model checking can be close to systematic testing, so we throw in a little example that illustrates the differences.

This provides analysts with a coherent description of the anomalies identified in the sequence, and why they differ from more 'normal' sequences.",

The work completed resulted in a HyDE model with the capability to diagnose five times the number of ADAPT components than was previously tested. The expanded diagnosis model passed a corresponding set of new ADAPT fault injection scenario tests with no incorrect faults reported. The time required for the HyDE diagnostic system to isolate the fault varied widely between tests; this variance was reduced by tuning of the HyDE input parameters. These results and other diagnostic design tradeoffs are discussed. Finally, possible future improvements for both the HyDE diagnostic model and HyDE itself are presented.",

		"Description": "TThe IDL Astronomy Library contains four different sets of procedures for reading, writing, and modifying FITS files. The reason for having four different methods of FITS I/O with IDL is partly historical, as different groups developed the software independently. However, each method also has its own strengths and weakness for any particular task. For example, the procedure MRDFITS() -- which can read a FITS table into an IDL structure --is the easiest procedure for analyzing FITS files at the IDL prompt level (provided that one is comfortable with IDL structures). But mapping a table into an IDL structure includes extra overhead, so that when performing FITS I/O at the procedure level, it may be desirable to use more efficient procedures such as FITS_READ and FTAB_EXT.",

The radiometric processing subsystem characterizes and corrects, where possible, radiometric qualities including: detector operability; gain; bias; coherent, impulse and random noise; signal-to-noise ratios (SNR); saturation levels; striping and banding; and the stability of detector performance. The geometric processing subsystem and analysis capabilities support sensor alignment calibrations; sensor chip assembly (SCA)-to-SCA alignments and related issues; geodetic accuracy assessments; modulation transfer function (MTF) characterizations; and perform image-to-image characterizations. The ALIAS also characterizes and corrects band-to-band registration, and performs systematic, precision and terrain correction of ALI images. The ALIAS can geometrically correct and automatically mosaic the SCA image strips into a seamless, map-projected image. The ALIAS was developed through collaboration between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).",

		"Description": "This software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",
