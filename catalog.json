Once uncompressed/unarchived into their original form, these files will be optimally striped for subsequent operations.",

        "Description": "This code was created to support the Distributed Engine Control task as part of the Fixed Wing Aeronautics project. The purpose of this research was to enable multiple microcontrollers to speak with eacho ther per the protocol specified in the preliminary release of EADIN BUS. EADIN BUS is a candidate for distributed control systems on aircraft engines. The primary use of this code was to assist in the modeling of small local networks which contain 16 or fewer nodes. This communication protocol differs from typical internet protocols by using a master node which distributes information between nodes through a call and response system. The RS-485 network is simplex and thus does not allow multiple nodes to talk at the same time. No time synchronization between  nodes is required for this network. These factors enable the master to request information from sensors and command actuators, one at a time. In the current implementation, no information is passed from individual nodes without first going through the master node. While other communication protocols do exist like ModbusMaster and simple-modbus, the speed of these communication protocols on the RS-485 network was not sufficient for our needs which required message send to reply receipt times of 1 millisecond. Additionally, the other protocols did not implement the same message system as specified by the preliminary documents regarding the EADIN protocol.",

The variable emissivity radiator aerogel insulation blanket dual zone thermal control experiment suite for responsive space (STP-H3-VADER) investigation tests a variable emissivity radiator and a new form of multilayer insulation that uses Aerogel as the thermal isolator in order to protect the spacecraft from the harsh extremes of the space environment. The Aerogel material provides a more durable, lighter and cheaper alternative to traditional spacecraft thermal blankets. The use of this material could reduce the costs related to spaceflight by reducing the required spacecraft mass and increasing design efficiency.",

The only required inputs are the surface crack dimensions (2c and a), plate cross-section dimensions (W and B), and linear plus power law material properties of elastic modulus, yield strength, and strain hardening coefficient. With the geometry and material parameters entered, TASC interpolates to the appropriate J(\u03a6) vs. crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and far-field tension stress, \u03c3, vs. CMOD solution, providing the full solution as CMOD ranges from zero out to the CMOD limit of the solution space for the given input parameters. TASC was developed by the Material and Processes Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.",

Multi-node cooperation allows different nodes to take part in the same task. Split file processing allows multiple threads to operate concurrently on the same file. Finally, additional optimizations such as buffer management help eliminate other bottlenecks that can reduce performance. Mutil currently includes drop-in replacements for cp and md5sum from GNU coreutils, which have achieved 10/30x rates on one/many nodes.",

Mesh adheres to fundamental security principles and was designed to be compatible with strong security mechanisms including two-factor authentication, SSH bastions, and restrictive firewalls. Mesh uses a remote command model, which is based on stock SSH clients and the syntax and commands already understood by users, thus requires no additional software or knowledge to utilize effectively. Several existing services have been integrated with Mesh to provide resource discovery and query, high performance file transfer, and job management.",

The architecture provides a secure, scalable and extensible communications and data system that supports all aspects of a mission from onboard processing through the Mission Operations Center (MOC) to public access on the Internet. The architecture includes an Application Programming Interface (API) and message bus to provide a publish and subscribe communication mechanism. The GMSEC architecture and source code are based on an enterprise architecture approach with a message-oriented cross-platform enterprise middleware (information software bus).",

This standard is used to support the exchange of component models for complex system simulations throughout Europe and the United States. Trick simulations are used all across NASA for simulations that support human spaceflight activities. However, until now, there were no means to use FMI based models in a Trick based simulation or a method for providing Trick based models that were FMI compliant. This software provides implementation software to do both. There are two principal components to the software: A C based software implementation for wrapping Trick based C models that provide an FMI compliant interface; A collection of C++ classes that can be used in a Trick based simulation to use an FMI compliant model (FMU).",

        "Description": "You might have noticed that we were a bit vague about what JPF actually is. It started as a software model checker, but nowadays there are various different execution modes and extensions, hence we have to explain what JPF does without getting lost in details of its application. What all JPF modes, which are runtime configured and not hardwired, have in common is that they are used to verify Java programs, to: find and explain defects, collect \"deep\" runtime information like coverage metrics, deduce interesting test vectors and create corresponding test drivers and many more... Although classic SW model checking is only one of these applications, it is still what JPF is mostly associated with. People often confuse this with testing, and indeed JPFs notion of model checking can be close to systematic testing, so we throw in a little example that illustrates the differences.

This problem domain contains both discrete and continuous behavior, and thus is directly relevant for the hybrid diagnostic tool HyDE. In FY2007 work was performed to expand the HyDE diagnosis model of the ADAPT system. The work completed resulted in a HyDE model with the capability to diagnose five times the number of ADAPT components than was previously tested. The expanded diagnosis model passed a corresponding set of new ADAPT fault injection scenario tests with no incorrect faults reported. The time required for the HyDE diagnostic system to isolate the fault varied widely between tests; this variance was reduced by tuning of the HyDE input parameters. These results and other diagnostic design tradeoffs are discussed. Finally, possible future improvements for both the HyDE diagnostic model and HyDE itself are presented.",

        "Description": "TThe IDL Astronomy Library contains four different sets of procedures for reading, writing, and modifying FITS files. The reason for having four different methods of FITS I/O with IDL is partly historical, as different groups developed the software independently. However, each method also has its own strengths and weakness for any particular task. For example, the procedure MRDFITS() -- which can read a FITS table into an IDL structure --is the easiest procedure for analyzing FITS files at the IDL prompt level (provided that one is comfortable with IDL structures). But mapping a table into an IDL structure includes extra overhead, so that when performing FITS I/O at the procedure level, it may be desirable to use more efficient procedures such as FITS_READ and FTAB_EXT.",

The radiometric processing subsystem characterizes and corrects, where possible, radiometric qualities including: detector operability; gain; bias; coherent, impulse and random noise; signal-to-noise ratios (SNR); saturation levels; striping and banding; and the stability of detector performance. The geometric processing subsystem and analysis capabilities support sensor alignment calibrations; sensor chip assembly (SCA)-to-SCA alignments and related issues; geodetic accuracy assessments; modulation transfer function (MTF) characterizations; and perform image-to-image characterizations. The ALIAS also characterizes and corrects band-to-band registration, and performs systematic, precision and terrain correction of ALI images. The ALIAS can geometrically correct and automatically mosaic the SCA image strips into a seamless, map-projected image. The ALIAS was developed through collaboration between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).",

        "Description": "This software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",

It extends the existing open source software's capabilities and functionality by bookkeeping more detailed information on internal data structures, as well as ensuring the consistency of mathematical conventions used by subroutines that are part of a third-party tool called ASOS as part of the modification. Additional convergence criteria have also been included, as well as the possibility for establishing additional constraints and modelling paradigms.",

This functional paradigm for specifying a domain allows a clean separation between the domain of ontological modeling (i.e., the focus of the OMF Core Functional API) from specific bindings for standards-based technology frameworks such as W3C's OWL, OMG's UML/SysML and, potentially, others. More importantly, the functional nature of this OMF Core API allows decoupling algorithms for analyzing, constructing, auditing, verifying, reasoning about OMF ontological models independently of the particular technology in which these ontological models are represented.",

There is an inherent tradeoff between maintaining slight variations of similar build configurations across multiple projects (i.e. no common sbt plugin) and defining a common sbt plugin reused across multiple projects to simplify their build configurations. Conceptually, the scope and purpose of this sbt plugin is very similar to the elegant nice-sbt-settings. Practically, nice-sbt-settings is indeed nicer.",

It is unique among similar libraries because of its capability to compute derivatives of the ODEs integrated outputs with respect to parameters, initial conditions, and the time interval. This is implemented in a manner that allows Ozone-based ODE models to be integrated in larger, potentially multidisciplinary models while using adjoint-type methods to compute derivatives for the larger model. In terms of the ODE integration, Ozone adopts the general linear methods (GLM) equations, allowing it to easily support a large library of Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods. Ozone also supports multiple integration formulations, consisting of time-marching, solver-based, and optimizer-based approaches to solving the ODE. Ozone is built on top of NASAs OpenMDAO software framework.",

Stochastic Reduced Order Models (SROMs) are low-dimensional, discrete representations of a given random vector being modeled that facilitate efficient stochastic calculations. SROMs can be viewed as a smart Monte Carlo method - using the concept for uncertainty propagation is similarly straightforward, but can significantly reduce computation time. An SROM is formed for a given target random vector by solving an optimization problem that determines it's parameters by minimizing the error between the statistics of the SROM and the target. Once the SROM is formed, it can be use to efficiently perform a probabilistic analysis. The SROMPy software package is a tool to solve the optimization problem efficiently to generate an SROM that can be used to propagate uncertainty through a given model.",

It includes a tutorial on structural finite element modeling (FEM_Tutorial.m) using elements such as 12 DOF plates and 6 DOF beams. The aero tutorial (DLM_VLM_Tutorial.m) shows how to code doublet lattice and vortex lattice, with symmetry capability. Together the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, as well as wind tunnel testing. The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces or they can be excluded. A state space model with control surface inputs and accelerometer outputs can be produced. This model is used to design a PID control system and is tested using margin studies and pole plots. Other visualization methods such as V-g plots determined using the K-method are also included. The code is commented for Graduate and Undergraduate students of aeroservoelasticity who want to know the basic concepts of medium fidelity aeroservoelastic modeling. Not all methods are coded to industry standards. But students of the field including practicing engineers may find it useful for basic understanding; theoretical manuals for industry level codes tend to leave out many of the coding details. All of the details of the code are open sourced here and most of it is referenced at the top of the file to its source paper or book section. Two AIAA publications with one focusing on V&V with experimental wind tunnel test and ground vibration test data are also included.",

Then the area of snow can be calculated for a region or for an individual watershed. Then a chart can be generated which would create a visual that shows the change in area covered by snow across images as a percentage of the whole area. As the sky islands stretch across much of Southeastern Arizona, the software also eliminates the need to download multiple images from differing rows/paths.",

Anomalies in NDVI values are then derived from Landsat 5 & 8 reference image collections from later dates (typically the year after the reference period to present). Various graphs and charts are produced showing positive and negative NDVI changes for specified points. The results are also visualized on the map as either areas of NDVI gain (displayed in green) or NDVI loss (displayed in red). The second types of scripts included scripts that perform unsupervised classifications to determine marsh extent for a variety of years and were made by applying a mask over the specified study area that incorporates elevation data to exclude regions over a specified height above average sea-level. These scripts require the user to choose classified pixel clusters that represent marsh land cover by using the Google Earth Inspector tab and then entering those values into the script to generate the marsh extent maps. Results of these scripts include classification maps for various years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc.). The user can then decide to export those results into either their Assets or their Drive, or both. A third type of script is used for statistics regarding the classified maps generated in the classification scripts. These statistics include total pixel number and total marsh area calculated into square meters after the marsh extent pixels are clipped to our study area (the State of Maryland).",

        "Description": "The Porous material Analysis Toolbox (PATO) is a modular analysis platform for multiphase porous reactive materials. It can be run as a simple Fourier heat transfer code or include more advanced features as internal decomposition (pyrolysis, vaporization), gas-gas and gas-solid chemical interactions (combustion, cracking, coking), gas species transport (convection, diffusion), and solid morphology evolutions (internal density changes, surface ablation). PATO is implemented as a C top level module of the open source (GNU GPL) computational fluid dynamics software program OpenFOAM. This offering is not approved or endorsed by OpenCFD Limited, the producer of the OpenFOAM software and owner of the OPENFOAM and OpenCFD trademarks. PATO also uses the open source (GNU LGPL) thermodynamics, transport, and chemistry library Mutation produced by the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics.",

        "Description": "The Curiosity rover has been on the surface of Mars for over five years. In that time, it has sent over 200,000 photos back to Earth. Using these photos, engineers at JPL have reconstructed the 3D surface of Mars for their scientists to use as a mission planning tool \u2013 surveying the terrain and identifying geologically significant areas for Curiosity to investigate further. And now you can explore the same Martian surface in your browser in an immersive WebVR experience. Access Mars features four important mission locations: the Landing Site, Pahrump Hills, Marias Pass, and Murray Buttes. Additionally, users can visit Curiosity's 'Current Location' for a look at where the rover has been in the past two to four weeks. And while you explore it all, JPL scientist Katie Stack Morgan will be your guide, teaching you about key mission details and highlighting points of interest.",
